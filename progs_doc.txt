These programs have been written in the course of work on differential
CpG methylation of the human genome and represent a series of tools
for preparing, modifying and analysing these data.  The work has
particularly focussed on reduced representation (RR) bisulphite
sequencing (RRBS) as in Meissner, et al., 2008, Nature, 454, 766-770,
Smith, et al., 2009) Methods, 48, 226-232 and Gu, et al., 2011, Nature
Protocols, 6, 468-481.  This software should, none-the-less, have
wider application than that.  From v1.70 the diffmeth program now
handles non-CpG methylation.

This package has been published in: Stockwell, P.A., Chatterjee, A.,
Rodger, E.J. and Morison, I.M. "DMAP: Differential Methylation
Analysis Package for RRBS and WGBS data" Bioinformatics (2014) DOI:
10.1093/bioinformatics/btu126.

This is research software so that it is not necessarily easy to use,
although it should work correctly as intended.  It works from a Unix
(MacOS X) or Linux command line interface: the notes below describe the
functionality and format of intermediate files where appropriate.
This code has been generated and tested on a MacOS X system (10.6)
using gcc v4.2.1 and on various Linux platforms (RedHat, Centos,
Fedora, Ubuntu) but is written to compile and run on any appropriate
C compiler and environment.  The size of files and data required for
this work will generally require a 64 bit environment.  Awk scripts
have been developed for the Gnu AWK (gawk) distributed with MacOS X
but, again, they should run in other comparable environments.

A previous requirement for the GNU database system gdbm to be
installed has been removed in releases from June 2014.

cleanadaptors V1.22 and later require zlib (data compression library),
preferably 1.2.5 or later.  This is available from www.zlib.net and
should be built and installed in accordance with instructions.

diffmeth 1.60 and later also require zlib in order to process bam
files.  An option exists to build diffmeth without zlib, but then
input is limited to sam files or CpG position lists.  The change has
also necessitated a change in one of the program options: -z is now
used to control bam/sam file usage - the no X,Y chromosome option is
now -Y.  Note that the -G method of giving chromosomal information is
preferred and makes the -Y option superfluous.

Distribution:

Now available from https://github.com/peterstockwell/DMAP either by
executing:

git clone https://github.com/peterstockwell/DMAP

producing a directory DMAP or by going to the github respository at

https://github.com/peterstockwell/DMAP

and using the 'Code' and 'Download ZIP' links to get the file
DMAP-master.zip which can be unpacked with:

unzip DMAP-master.zip
 
creating a directory DMAP-master.

In either case cd into the directory (DMAP/src or DMAP-master/src) and
execute

make

Some warnings may appear but these can be ignored.  The executables
will be in the src directory - no install targets are provided, the
completed executables (rmapbsbed2cpg bin_cnts scan_cpg_depth
mkrrgenome cleanadaptors identgeneloc diffmeth) should be manually
copied to an appropriate directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin).  The awk
scripts are in the src directory and may similarly be copied somewhere
useful.

If compilations fail with the error "undefined reference to
`gzbuffer'" then you are using an older version of zlib.  If updating
zlib (see above) is not possible then execute:

make clean
make nogzbuffer

which should build the package successfully.  The gzbuffer() call is
made to improve the effectiveness of zlib compression, but it is
dispensible.

If the diffmeth compile fails through the lack of zlib, then this
should be obtained and installed (see above).  If that is not possible
then you can build the programs without zlib, but it will not be
possible to read bam files or process gzip compressed fastq with
cleanadaptors.  To do this execute:

make nozlib

In this event, it will be necessary to convert .bam files to .sam
which can be done with samtools with commands like:

samtools view -h mybamfile.bam > mybamfile.sam

cleanadaptors can be used by prior decompression of the fastq files
with commands like:

gzip -dc myfastqfile.fastq.gz > myfastqfile.fastq

----------------------------------------------------------------------
rmapbsbed2cpg

Converts a rmapbs BED file or a bsmap output file to a tab-separated
list of Chromosome Position Methylation_status where: 

Chromosome is one of 1,2,3..22,X,Y (for Human) or as defined in
  chromosome information file (-G option)
Position is an integer
Methylation_status is + or -

This form is suitable for reading into SeqMonk [Text (Generic) format]
or for other programs in this set (cnt_cpg_bins, scan_cpg_depth,
diffmeth).

Format of the source files is as documented for the Rmap programs
(Smith, et al. 2008, BMC Bioinformatics, 9, 128-135.).  The format for
bsmap 1.02 is approximately as documented in the README.txt
distributed with that program (Xi & Li, 2009, BMC Bioinformatics, 10,
232-240), although the actual output is not wholly consistent with
their notes.  Further, the output format has been changed at some
point, bsmap 1.2 output is now accepted.

rmapbsbed2cpg expects either a file of reads in FASTQ format or in
FASTA format with a single entry for each read, and with no quality
information.  The included script illum2fasta.awk will generate such a
file from the FASTQ original, noting that the header for each sequence
is shortened in the following way:

HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:4:1135:18558#0/1

becomes:

>S1_4_1135_185558

or generally

>S{LaneNo}_{TileNo}_{Xpixel}_{Ypixel}

so that each read can be related back to its original FASTQ form. This
form is that generated by the illum2fasta.awk script included in the
distribution.

rmapbsbed2cpg will now correctly manage HiSeq flowcells with different
tile numbers from the original GAII flowcells.  Also V3 of the
chemistry is managed (see -v and -V) options.

Chromosome sequences are expected as FASTA files with a single entry
for each chromosome in its own file (as for the GRCh37 build used by
Bismark/SeqMonk).  Each chromosome file name should end <n>.fa where
<n> is 1,2,3..22,X,Y (for human).  The program allows for the complete
set to be addressed by an absolute or relative path (e.g.
/Volumes/SomeDiskName/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome.
or ../../WhereIPutThem/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome. ).
Alternatively, the -G option lets each chromosome be specified by its
own identifier (which need not be 1,2,...,X,Y) and the fasta file
containing the sequence.  This option, as for other programs in the
set, permits avian chromosome sets, mitochondrial sequences and for
the various files to be located in different places.

Program Options:

rmapbsbed2cpg (v2.32): generate list of CpG positions from rmapbs BED file
Options:
     -r <readfile> reads from Fasta fmt. <readfile>
     -R <readfile> reads from fastq <readfile>
     -v HiSeq V3 flowcell, V2 chemistry (def V2 GAII flowcell)
     -V HiSeq V3 flowcell, V3 chemistry (def V2 GAII flowcell)
     -b <bedfile> read match information from <bedfile> (rmapbs bed format)
     -B <bsmapfile> read match information from <bsmapfile> (bsmap V1.02 output format)
     -A <bsmapfile> read match information from <bsmapfile> (bsmap V1.2 output format)
     -p <posfile> read RR sections (mkrrgenome -m output) from <posfile>, count hits/misses
     -g <genomehead> dir and file string to locate genomic seq files by adding n.fa
 or  -G <chrinfofl> chromosome IDs & get genomic seq filesfrom <chrinfofl>
     -k <maxchrno> allow upto maxchrno different chromosomes (def = ChrY, 24)
     -z don't expect XY chromosomes, just numbers (def=do)

-v & -V interpret tile numbers as for HiSeq flowcells, versions 2 & 3
chemistry, respectively.  By default GAII flowcells are expected with
tile numbers 1..120.  When the other options are selected, the program
remaps the file numbers 1101..2308 to successive integer values in
order to minimise internal array dimensions.

Output is to stdout.

The program works by loading the reads into a series of linked lists
by tile number.  Each chromosome is read into a long string in RAM,
pre-malloc()ed to contain an adequately long sequence.  The aligned
read information from the BED or bsmap files is read and the
positional information is used to set start & stop locations for each
read in the tile-based linked list repository.  Difficulty was
encountered with bsmap runs where some run options will generate
shortened read alignments and for which out-by-one position errors
were evident.  Shortened reads require that the original FASTA file
sequence read is replaced by the actual bsmap-returned alignment read
and appropriate position corrections made.

The program uses linked lists in order to prevent array-length limits
from restricting operation arbitrarily and between that and the need
to store the complete sequence of each chromosome poses large RAM
requirements.  Linear scanning through linked lists also takes time
and while strategies could be devised to improve this performance, the
present execution time and RAM needs are acceptable.  Running some
15e06 reads against the human genome on the development machine (Mac
Pro, Duo Quad Core 2.8GHz) takes several hours and requires some 8Gb
RAM.  (The code is single threaded and does not, itself, benefit from
multiple cores.)

A typical run might look like

rmapbsbed2cpg -r myfastafmtreads.fa -b rmapbsoutput.bed -g
/Volumes/VMWare/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome. >
myrmapbscpglist.txt

where the whole command is complete on one line.

or:

rmapbsbed2cpg -r myfastafmtreads.fa -b rmapbsoutput.bed -G hs_GRCh37_chr_info.txt \
 > myrmapbscpglist.txt

where hs_GRCh37_chr_info.txt contains lines like:

1 /Volumes/Data2/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.65.dna.chromosome.1.fa
10 /Volumes/Data2/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.65.dna.chromosome.10.fa

See the diffmeth documentation (below) for more details of chromosome
information files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
bin_cnts:

Still under significant development: to take CpG positions as
generated by rmapbsbed2cpg or the Bismark methylation_extractor
programs and store the counts in a series of bins which are generated
in a series of different ways.  The program further aims to produce
figures for differential methylation by the method of Li, et al.
(2010, PLOSBiology,11,e1000533) and contains procedures to assist with
bin selection for that.  RRBS based bin selection is supported and the
program output allows either the contents of such bins to be listed
or, optionally, for the counts which miss such bins to be shown, in
order to indicate when aligners are mapping reads outside expected RR
regions.  The program is also capable of generating pseudo feature
table information for SeqMonk so that RR genomes can be annotated with
RR fragment positions.

The source file(s) for -r & -R options are as generated by
rmapbsbed2cpg.

Chromosome source files (-g option) are specified as for
rmapbsbed2cpg.

Options:

bin_cnts: create binned counts for chromosomal positions
Options:
     -r <posfile> read <posfile> as set of chr posit strand/meth
     -R <posfile2> as -r but for 2nd position file
     -b <binlength>: set bin length (def=1000)
     -g <genomehead> dir and file string to locate genomic seq files by adding n.fa
     -l/-L list bins (-L=>only nonzero bins)
     -m scan for diff meth regions restricted rep (Li, et al. (2010) PLOSBiology,11,e1000533)
     -M <j,k> scan for restricted rep fragment sizes between j & k residues. Make bins
     -N as for -M but list bins to stdout
     -k as for -M, but note reads which don't map into restricted rep bins
     -K as for -k, but only print totals for meth & unmeth counts
     -S <dirheader> write .dat files to <dirheader> for RR genome for SeqMonk
     -c <n> restrict effort to Chromosome <n> (def = all chromosomes)
     -C <n> restrict bins to those with <n> or more CpGs
     -A attempt to amalgamate restr rep regions that might otherwise fail CpG criteria
(     -x <excludefile> exclude regions (fmt: Chrno regionstart
regionend) 

Output is generally to stdout, excepting the -S option.

The -c option to restrict operation to a single selected chromosome is
really only for developing the program in order to speed up checking
its operation.

The -M, -N, -k & -K options use the MspI recognition/cleavage site
C^CGG and the j,k size range to select valid fragments.  If either j
or k is zero, then that limit is not applied (e.g. -M 0,220 will
include all MspI fragments from zero to 220 residues; -m 50,0 will
include all fragments over 50 residues).  Note that the program
applies the limits precisely whereas fragment size selection on a gel
will never be so exact.

The -x option to exclude some chromosomal regions has not been
implemented yet.

Differential methylation (-m option) is yet to be implemented.

Like rmapbsbed2cpg, bin_cnts used linked lists for internal data
storage in order to avoid arbitrary limits.  The strategy for scanning
genomic sequences for CCGG and CpG sites avoids the need to load
chromosome sequences into RAM.  The consequences are that bin_cnts has
a lesser memory footprint that rmapbsbed2cpg although moderate run
times can be expected.

Typical use might be:

bin_cnts -r myrmapbscpglist.txt -g
/Volumes/VMWare/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome.
-M 40,220 -L > mynonzero40_220bins.cnts

will list the nonzero bins for 40 to 220 bp MspI fragments to a file
mynonzero40_220bins.cnts.

bin_cnts -r myrmapbscpglist.txt -g
/Volumes/VMWare/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome.
-k 40,220 > missed40_220bins.cnts

will list bins which contain counts that don't fit in the 40-220 RR
genome bins.

bin_cnts -r myrmapbscpglist.txt -g
/Volumes/VMWare/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome.
-K 40,220

will return to stdout (terminal) methylated and unmethylated total counts
which miss the RR genome bins.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
scan_cpg_depth:

NOTE: the code for this program is out of date and needs extensive
revision to allow for non-human genomes, SAM & BAM file input and
alternative nuclease recognition sites.  This work is in progress but
incomplete, so scan_cpg_depth is not compiled as part of the current
distribution.

Scans for the read depth of CpG positions on the genome.  Also will
list reads which don't map to CpGs in order to track down problems.
Returned information is a raw list of CpG positions with the counts,
statistics (mean, median and mode and standard deviation of count
distribution) or a histogram of count frequencies.

The source file (-r option) is as generated by rmapbsbed2cpg.

Chromosome source files (-g option) are specified as for
rmapbsbed2cpg.

scan_cpg_depth: scan for CpG read depth for all or selected chromosomes
Options:
     -r <posfile> read <posfile> as set of chr posit strand/meth
     -g <genomehead> dir and file string to locate genomic seq files by adding n.fa
     -C <m> use cluster size of <m> for chromosome positions, Def=1000
     -l list each CpG to stdout with counts
     -c <n> restrict to Chromosome <n> 1..22,X,Y. Def=all
     -p Permit out-by-one positions (e.g. Bismark complementary strand CpGs) def=don't
     -S generate statistics (range, mean, std deviation, etc. for counts
     -H generate histogram of counts
     -m list missed CpG lines
     -n list CpG hits (Nonmisses)
     -z omit zero count from histogram

Output is to stdout.

The -C clustersize option is to control the scheme which allows rapid
lookups into the linked lists of chromosomal CpG positions to prevent
the program from taking excessively long to execute.  The default
cluster size is 1000, decreasing it will increase the memory
requirements, but decrease execution time.  Conversely...

The genome files are specified by the -g option, as above.

-l will generate a very lengthy list of CpG positions and the + & -
counts for each.

-S generates statistics for the depth of hits at each CpG.  Note that
this presently includes the 0 count bin which probably produces
misleading values, since typical RR runs will not hit all CpGs.

-H produces a printer-type histogram of count frequencies.  Since the
zero count bin will always contain unhitable CpGs, the -z option is
offered to scale the histogram to the highest non-zero count.  Note
that the statistics output (-S) is not altered by -z.

For diagnostic purposes, the -m and -n options are given to produce a
list of the missed or hit positions respectively before other output
options are processed.

For reads pairing to the complementary sequence some aligners
(e.g. Bismark v 0.2.3 methylation_extractor) produce alignment
positions that are out-by-one.  The -p option will permit positions to
be out by one residue in order to use all of the read data.

e.g.:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mkrrgenome:

Scans fasta files for MspI (C^CGG) or other cleavage positions and
concatenates the fragments for each chromosome which fit into a
specified size range into a single contiguous sequence in a fasta
file.  Optionally generates a list of those positions.  V1.2 (or
later) permits runs with non-human chromosome sets. Further, v1.22 (or
later) also enables a file of chromosome IDs and file names with the
-G option.

./mkrrgenome (v1.23): generate reduced representation genome files for MspI (or other) digests
Options:
     -g <genomehead> dir and file string to locate genomic seq files by adding n.fa
 or  -G <chr_info_file> file of chromosome IDs and filenames
     -k <MaxCNo> set maximum chromosome number (def = ChrY for Humans)
     -z Don't expect X/Y chromosomes, only numbered names (def=do)
     -c <C_no> restrict activity to chromosome C_no (1..22,X,Y), def = all
     -M <j,k> scan for restricted rep fragment sizes between j & k residues. (def=40..220)
     -m <j,k>   ditto, produce tab delimited list of positions to stdout
     -p <j,k> generate tabbed list of CpG positions for j-k fragments
     -P generate tabbed list of all CpG positions
     -H <desthead> dir & file string for output genome files (-M), completed with n.fa
     -n <restrictionfile> - use sites in <restrictionfile>, def=MspI

Input files are specified with the -g or -G options as previously. The
-g option requires each chromosome to be present as a separate file
which can be located by adding <n>.fa where <n> is a chromosome number
or X,Y. -G requires each chromosome to be a in a separate file but
takes the chromosome ID and the corresponding file from lines in a
text file.  This permits wider variation in chromosome naming, file
location and the ability to process various subsets of chromosomes.

Output is to a fasta file for each chromosome processed - the pathname
and initial file name for the whole series is specified by the -G
option.

Desired fragment size is specified for the -M, -m & -p options as two
comma-separated values for the minimum and maximum values.  Giving a 0
as one of the values will disable that comparison so that, for
instance, -M 0,150 will use all fragments up to 150 bp while -M 40,0
will save all fragments over 40 bp.

Options:

-M generates a fasta file of the valid RR fragments concatenated into
a single sequence for each chromosome specified.

-m perform the same scan as -M but generate a tab-delimited list of
the relevant positions to stdout.

-p generate a tabbed list of CpG positions for all valid RR fragments
to stdout.

-P generate a tabbed list of all CpG positions to stdout.

-k set the maximum chromosome number - allows use with genomes other
than human.  The number given should be the number of different
chromosomes: e.g. human with 22 chromosomes + X + Y would require
-k 24.

-z disable XY labelling for 2 highest number chromosomes.  Necessary
for organisms like Danio rerio which has a diploid set of 25
chromosomes but no sex chromosomes.

-c restrict operation to a specific chromosome - really for testing
purposes.

-n use a file of restriction sites instead of the default MspI site
for cleavage.  The format of the file is as for diffmeth -n (see
below).

mkrrgenome uses a finite-state-machine (FSM) method for the rapid
scanning of chromosomal sequences for CCGG sites and for quantifying
CpGs.

e.g.: 

mkrrgenome -g \
/Volumes/Human_genome/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome. \
-M 20,240 -G myRR_20_240genome/rrChr

will process each of the files
Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome.1.fa, etc. to a RR genome for
size 10..240 MspI fragments saving each chromosome as rrChr1.fa,
etc. in the local directory myRR_20_240genome.  The fasta headers will
resemble:

>1rr reduced repr 20..240 for MspI digest Chr1 7215473/249250621bp CpG: 413964

or e.g.:

mkrrgenome -g \
/Volumes/Human_genome/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.59.dna.chromosome. \
-c 22 -m 20,240

will generate a listing with a line for each MspI fragment in the size
range 20..240 bp of chromosome 22 like:

22	16054424..16054453 (30 bp) CpG: 3
22	16060689..16060841 (153 bp) CpG: 2
22	16075293..16075412 (120 bp) CpG: 3
22	16075413..16075526 (114 bp) CpG: 2
22	16075527..16075627 (101 bp) CpG: 5
22	16085649..16085716 (68 bp) CpG: 4
22	16086414..16086578 (165 bp) CpG: 3
22	16086912..16086959 (48 bp) CpG: 2
22	16094410..16094476 (67 bp) CpG: 3
22	16096038..16096177 (140 bp) CpG: 7

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cleanadaptors:

Check FASTQ or FASTA sequence read files for adaptor sequences and
trim them if desired.  The use of short RR libraries can result in
longer Illumina reads sequencing through into the adaptor sequence
giving reads that may fail to align even although the pre-adaptor
section is valid.  Alternatively, if reads containing a significant
length of adaptor succeed in aligning then they are more likely to be
erroneously placed and will contribute unwanted bias to analyses.

cleanadaptors uses a finite-state-machine (FSM) to provide a very
efficient means of finding leading fragments of adaptor sequences,
then completes the checks by comparing the trailing sequence with the
whole adaptor to ensure that a reasonable degree of similarity is
achieved.  Since read qualities deterioriate at higher cycle numbers,
complete matching is not expected.

Version 1.2 of the program now allows for pair-end runs in which the
pairing is maintained and it further permits quality trimming and
truncation to a maximum length.  Adaptor sequence files can be in
either simple text or fasta formats.

Version 1.22 is able to read/write gzip compressed data files.

Output options include listing the source data with adaptor matches
indicated in the listing (-f), or to have the reads trimmed to remove
any adaptor sequences which achieve criteria for matching (-F).  In
order to trace operation of the program, match listings can show only
reads which do match (-H).

cleanadaptors v1.22: scan Illumina reads for adaptor seqs: Trim FASTA/FASTQ files
Options:
     -i <adaptorfile> file of adaptor seqs (1/line)
     -I <adaptorfile> fasta file of adaptor seqs
     -a max adaptor length (def=256)
     -m min leading match for adaptor (def=6)
     -M margin at read end for trimming (def=0)
     -R readfile buffer length (def=256)
     -s <skipres> skip <skipres> on each read before checking matches
     -p <%> % match threshold with adaptor sequence for hit (def=85.0%)
     -S enable single base mismatches (def=disallow)
     -L print fsm to stdout
     -F <readfile>: run scan on <readfile> FASTQ/FASTA fmt, trim matching ends
     -x <lengthlimit>: only save trimmed reads exceeding length limit (def=1)
     -t <3'trimlength>: take further 3'trimlength bases before adaptor match (def=0)
     -q <phredscore> quality trim reads to longest section > Q<phredscore> (def=don't)
     -Q <qualbase> change base for quality scores (def=33)
     -N <readfile>: fill lines with 'N's rather than trimming
     -f <readfile>: run scan on <readfile> FASTQ/FASTA fmt, show all reads, indicate matches
     -H <readfile>: run scan on <readfile> FASTQ/FASTA fmt, indicate matches on hit reads only
     -G <read2file>: paired end input: trim both ends, retain valid paired reads
     -l <trimlength> max length for output reads (def=nolimit)
     -z enable gzip compression input & output. Positional (def=nocompression)
     -Z disable gzip compression. Positional: effects following -F,-G,-o,-O files (def=-Z)
     -o <dstfile>: write output to dstfile (read1 data for paired ends) def=stdout
     -O <r2dstfile>: output file for read2 - needed for paired run
       if <readfile> is '-', then use stdin, for uncompressed input

Options:

-i,-I <adaptorfile> opens the adaptor sequence file, either 1 per line
(-i) or a fasta format file (-I).  If neither of these options is
used, the program omits adaptor trimming, but will still perform
quality trimming and will apply length limits to the output.

-a : Only necessary if the length of any adaptor sequence exceeds 256
bp.

-m sets the minimum length for an initial adaptor match.  The default
(6) is a reasonable value.  Note that enabling single base mismatches
(-S) will reduce the required match by 1 over this length.  See -T
option for RRBS data.

-M sets the 3' margin for matches before reads will be trimmed.  So, a
value of 10 would only trim if the adaptor match was in the last 10
residues of the read.  The default is 0 which means don't apply this
criterion.

-R sets the read buffer length and is only necessary if reads or
header lines exceed 256 characters.

-s sets the number of residues skipped before adaptor matches will be
checked.  Clearly if a reduced representation library of say 40-220 bp
has been used, then there should be no need to check for adaptor
sequences before 40 bp of each read, hence setting -s 40 would achieve
this, giving a marginal increase in performance.

-p sets the % match of read vs entire adaptor sequence, from the point
where the match begins till the end of the read or the adaptor.
85.0% is the default.  The performance of the program does not seem to
be very sensitive to this value, increasing it from the default to 90%
only makes a marginal change in the number of residues trimmed on real
data.

-S enables single base mismatches during the FSM scan operation and
may help if there is a significant tendency for single residue read
errors.  This option extensively lengthens the time taken to build the
FSM, since it causes each base position to be expanded to A,C,G & T
for all of the adaptor lengths from the minimum to the full length.
Given that the default scanning looks for a 6 bp match to the start of
the adaptor sequence and then checks for 85.0% or greater match over
the full adaptor length, this option is probably not really needed, so
the default is for it to be disabled.

-t trims further back into the read in case it is necessary to remove
library generating artifacts between the adaptor and the read proper.
Requires an integer value.  This is applied before size checking with
the -x option.  This option is particularly relevant for RRBS data.

-L lists the FSM to stdout: no read scanning is done.  This is really
for checking the FSM-building process.

-f lists the entire read file with adaptor matches and their quality
shown.

-H similar to -f, except that only reads which have matches meeting
the criteria are shown.  For testing purposes mainly.

-F,-G perform the trim operation, writing the trimmed data to stdout
or the defined -o output file for -F, and to the -O file for -G.  When
both -F & -G are used on paired end reads, the matching of paired ends
between the reads is conserved.  Resulting sequences shorter than the
limit defined by -x and their headers are suppressed.  The -f, -H & -F
options will accept '-' as a file specification so that cleanadaptor
runs can be piped together with a command like:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -F src_r1.fastq | cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -H -

which will read the original reads from src_r1.fastq, trim with
adaptors from contam.fa then display any remaining matches.  The
option of using cleanadaptors as a pipe is not available for the
second read in paired end runs - the -G and -O options will require
valid source and destination file names.

-x sets the minimum length for a trimmed read to be saved, defaults to
1.  The Bowtie aligner used by Bismark requires a minimum of 4 bp, so
this option can be used to suppress the rejection of shorter trimmed
reads at the alignment stage.  Setting the limit to zero disables the
check.

-N replaces trimmed sequence (and quality chars) with 'N's in order to
conserve the line length.  Rmapbs seems to require this.  The effects
of -x are as for trimmed lines.  In the unlikely event that it is
desired to write out lines which have no untrimmed sequence, then -x 0
will permit that.

-l allows a maximum output length to be enforced.  All output reads
will be equal to or less than the length specified.

-q allows quality trimming of reads (for fastq files) to the quality
score specified.  The default setting is for phred quality scoring
starting with a base of 33 ascii.  The -Q option can be used to change
the base.

-Q allows the base for quality trimming to changed. The default is -Q
33 for phred quality scoring as used from bcl2fastq V 1.8.3.

-o,-O specify output files for the first (-F) and second (-G) reads.
If a single read is being processed, then -F can be used with a '-' to
take input from stdin and the default output is to stdout, enabling
cleanadaptors to function as part of a Unix/Linux pipeline.  Paired
end runs can use this form of pipe and redirection for the first read,
but the second must be specified by giving valid source and
destination files to the -G and -O options.  It would be more usual to
give source and destination files for both -F, -G and -o,-O in such
cases.

-T specify 5' truncation from the start of each adaptor sequence.
Experience with RRBS data shows that some trimmed reads contain
adaptor sequence which has misreads in the first two positions so that
they are not deleted.  This option allows cleanadaptors to use the FSM
strategy and still delete adaptor sequences which have an early
mismatch: e.g. with -T 2.  This option (like -t) is probably only
relevant for RRBS data - tests with real data have shown that fastqc
may find remaining contaminating adaptors unless this option is used.

-z,-Z control gzip compression for source and destination files.
These parameters are positional and will exert their effect for input
and output file specifications following them on the command line.
Multiple uses are possible to enable/disable compression for the
different files.  If compression is used, the default stdin and stdout
source/destination files are not available.  See examples below.

Examples:

Trim adaptors from contam.fa for paired ends with Q20 and minimum
output length of 50 bp:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -q 20 -x 50 -F src_r1.fastq \
 -o trim_r1.fastq -G src_r2.fastq -O dst_r2.fastq

Just do Q20 trimming with minimal output length of 50, single ended:

cleanadaptors -q 20 -x 50 -F src_r1.fastq > dst_r2.fastq

Trim adaptors with minimum output length of 50, max 100 bp, single
ended:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -x 50 -l 100 -F src_r1.fastq -o dst_r1.fastq

Trim adaptors from and to compressed fastq files:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -z -F src_r1.fastq.gz -o dst_r1.fastq.gz

Trim adaptors from uncompressed to compressed fastq:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -F src_r1.fastq -G src_r2.fastq -z -o dst_r1.fastq.gz \
  -O dst_r2.fastq.gz

Trim adaptors from compressed to uncompressed fastq:

cleanadaptors -I contam.fa -z -F src_r1.fastq.gz -G src_r2.fastq.gz \
  -Z -o dst_r1.fastq -O dst_r2.fastq

----------------------------------------------------------------------
illum2fasta.awk

a script which converts illumina fastq read files into fasta format.
The header lines are simplified in a way which reduces the read IDs
significantly in length but retains lane number, tile number and pixel
coordinates so that it remains possible to trace back to the original
fastq reads.  For instance, the fastq lines

@HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:1:1132:9986#0/1

Clearly the quality lines are eliminated, but the other information is
coerced into a form which should be valid for FASTA file readers.

Use: run with awk.  The output is to stdout, so normal redirection
will work.

e.g.:

awk -f illum2fasta.awk s_1_sequence.txt > s_1_fasta.fa

The script is relatively rapid, processing 18x10^6 100bp reads took
about 7 minutes on a Mac Pro with dual quad core Xeon 2.8 GHz CPUs
though only a single core was employed.  Far too rapid to be bothered
writing something more efficient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
mk4to1lines.awk

a script to write each group of 4 fast2 lines to a single line for the
purposes of filtering bad tiles using Unix/Linux commands.  The
process is easily reversed using the tr command.  The new line
characters for each read are replaced with a default of ';'.

For instance in an experiment it is wished to eliminate tiles 1, 2, 3,
40, 63, 119 & 120 due to airbubbles or inferior performance at flow
cell extremes.  So a series of lines matching the fastq header lines
for that series of poor tiles, like:

FC706VJ:1:1:
FC706VJ:1:2:
FC706VJ:1:3:
FC706VJ:1:40:
FC706VJ:1:63:
FC706VJ:1:119:
FC706VJ:1:120:

would be written to a text file (kill_tiles.txt for example), then the
complete reads for those tiles could be deleted from the experiment by
the following command:

awk -f mk4to1lines.awk s_1_sequence.txt | grep -v -f kill_tiles.txt | \
tr ";" "\n" > s_1_seq_filtered.txt

in which the grep command will pass all lines not matching any entries
in the kill_tiles.txt file and the tr command restores ';' line
separators to Unix/Linux new lines.

The default line separator for this script can be altered by the
following, in this case to a '!':

awk -f mk4to1lines.awk -v catchar='!' s_1_sequence.txt

The value of this script and these operations may be less important
for HiSeq information, since the reduced number of tiles will cause
too much data to be discarded in comparison with the Illumina GAIIx
platform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
bismmethex2list.awk

a script to generate simple tab-delimited lists of chromosome No,
position, methylation status from the output of the BisMark
methylation_extractor program.  This leaves the data in a form which
is amenable to further processing by scan_cpg_depth or bin_cnts.

The operation is very simple, the extractor produces lines ending in
'Z' for methylated CpG and 'z' for unmethlated.  This script just
converts these to +/-.

Changes in header lines from CASAVA 1.8 have required a modification
since more fields are now written to the output file.  The variable
zcol defines where the script expects the 'Z' & 'z' chars to be.  zcol
presently defaults to 5 for GAII style headers, but should be defined
to 6 for HiSeq output.

Use:

awk -f bismmethex2list.awk CpG_CTOT_s_1_sequence.txt_bismark.txt

or

awk -f bismmethex2list.awk zcol=6 CpG_CTOT_hiseq_casava1.8.txt_bismark.txt

writes the converted lines to stdout where they can be captured by
commandline redirection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
tidyrrnams.awk

Script to correct chromosome names from mkgenomes.  In order to
distinguish the names from the unmodified defaults (1,2..22,X,Y) they
have rr appended to them, but this can complicate downstream
processing, hence this script which can flexibly remove rr suffixes.
This script replaces a number of earlier ones which had been tailored
to specific output file formats but, by writing this version in a
slightly more intelligent way, it manages variant formats, like .BED
files and bsmap output.  

E.g. rmapbs output run on RR genome gives:

Xrr	529488	529538	HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:2:10354:4724#0/1	1	+
15rr	241793	241843	HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:3:5446:13600#0/1	7	+
16rr	2800644	2800694	HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:5:13647:7002#0/1	5	+
[...]

where we need to modify field 1, so the command

awk -f <path>tidyrrnams.awk splitfield=1 <mybedfile>.bed > <modifiedfile>.bed

will alter the chromsome ids to X,15,16... respectively for this
example.  splitfield defaults to 1 so the parameter 'splitfield=1'
could be omitted.

bsmap generates output like:

HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:1:6899:15689#0/1	GGTAATTTTTTTTATTGTTTTTTGTAGTAGGTGTTGAGT	UM	Xrr	613451	-+	0	1:0:0:0:0	mC
HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:1:6900:16423#0/1	GGGTTTTTGTTTTATAAAGTGGGTAGTGGTAAAGTGTTG	UM	2rr	1760913	-+	0	1:0:0:0:0	mC
HWI-EAS209_0006_FC706VJ:1:1:6900:4193#0/1	GGAATAGTTTTTGGTATATAGTAGGTATTTAATAATTGT	UM	5rr	2861341	++	1	0:1:0:1:0	mC

once unique matches are selected, with the chromosome id in the fourth
field.  So the command:

awk -f <path>tidyrrnams.awk splitfield=4 <mybsmapoutfile> > <renamedbsmapfile>

will work.

Bismark output writes the chromosome name to the 3rd field of output
report files, so 'splitfield=3' is appropriate there.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
getcpgpcmeth.awk

script to process some of diffmeth output to give the percent
methylation of individual CpGs.  The output is a tabbed list of
chromosome, position and %methylation.  Where the %methylation cannot
be calculated a '-' is written.  This script requires diffmeth >=
V1.41.

Use: with diffmeth as pipeline:

diffmeth -e 40,220 \
-g /Volumes/Data2/HomoSapiens_genome/hs_ref_GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.65.dna.chromosome. \
-R ../X12/bismark_at3/X12_ad3tr85.fastq_bismark.sam \
| awk -f getcpgpcmeth.awk

See diffmeth notes for options.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
diffmeth:

executable to generate MspI, or other, fragment-based bins for a
genome and map counts from either a text file of <chromosome>
<position> <+/-> lines, a SAM file or a BAM file generated by later
versions of the Bismark mapper.  The original differential methylation
algorithm proposed by Li, et al. (2010, PLOSBiology,11,e1000533) is
not easily applicable to RRBS work and this program adopts a RRBS
fragment-based approach in contrast to the sliding-window scheme of
others.

Probabilities are derived for the observed counts: the code allows
investigation of pairwise Fisher's Exact or chi-square probabilities
where appropriate.  Output can be constrained to one or the other and
made to calculate chi-squares only for samples and fragments for which
the usual chi-square restriction of all expected values >= 5.0 holds.
In our use, the latter option is preferred, since pairwise Fisher's
Exact comparisons typically return a range of probabilities from very
low to unimpressive for a given fragment, but usually the shown value
is the lowest, masking the extent of similar methylation across the
individuals compared.  V1.43 onwards enables treatment vs control
processing returning the analysis of variance (ANOVA) F ratio for
treatment/residual variation and returns the probability of the F
value using code modified from 'Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of
Scientifc Computing' (ISBM 0-521-43108-5).  From v1.71 diffmeth can
perform ANOVA on more than two treatment groups: see options -a, -A,
-B and the -R and -S for further information.

The output can be set to show only fragments meeting a specified Pr
threshold, or for which calculations can be validly made for a
specified minimum number of individuals.

From v1.70 diffmeth will now process non-CpG methylation with the -J
option.

Command Options:  Note that this is a work in progress, not all of
these have been implemented: some may never be. Also, the -z option
for no X,Y chromosomes of versions 1.55 and prior has been replaced
with -Y and -z/-Z is now used to control bam/sam file input.

     -W <binwidth> make fixed width bins (def=MspI by size)
     -n <restrictionfile> - use sites in <restrictionfile>, def=MspI
     -J include non-CpG methylation

To explain some of these options:

-G: A file specifying each chromosome and the file of its sequence.
Use this option instead of -g if: (1) files are in different
directories, (2) naming is not consistent for -g to work, (3) genome
has chromosome IDs other than numbers, X & Y (e.g. avian or
mitochondrial) or (4) you want a subset of chromosomes.  Format of the
file is lines of <ChromosomeID> <Filename>
(e.g. "Y" "/Genomes/hs_GRCh37/HomoSapiens_Chr_Y.fasta").
Chromosomes in the output will appear in the same order as they are in
the file. Filenames containing spaces should be enclosed in double
quotes '"'.  Any characters on a line after a '#' (if unquoted) will
be regarded as a comment.

-g: Obsolete, use -G: As for other programs: the head for the genome
sequence files to be completed by <n>.fa where <n> is the chromosome
identifier/number.

-r: the name of a file of methylated positions comprising <Chromosome>
<position> <methylationstate>, e.g. "12 2457821 +".  Multiple files
are expected with multiple -r options.

-R: name of a SAM or BAM file of mapped reads from bismark.  Multiple
-R options are expected and can be mixed with -r position files.  The
advantage of using SAM/BAM files is to avoid the 1 bp offset generated
by the bismark methylation_extractor for which the -m option was
required.

-s or -S: similar to -r/-R but distinguishes files belonging to a
contrasting group for treatment/control comparisons.  This option is
intended for the -a & -A statistical specifiers for ANOVA calculations
or for pairwise Fisher's Exact (-P) where it will return the
proportion of methylation for each sample..

-r,-R,-s & -S for multiple sample groups: in order to specify samples
belonging to more than two groups, these options have been augmented
so that more groups can be managed.  The option letters can be
followed by an integer (1,2,3...) to indicate to which group each
sample file belongs.  The integers would normally be sequential, but
need not necessarily be so.  The first group should be indicated by
-R1, the second by -R2 and so forth.  If this method is being used,
then -S1 and -R1 become equivalent - it would not be desirable to mix
-Rn and -S since -S would always indicate the second group.  If only
two groups are required, then -R and -S will work as they did
previously.  See the -B option for further information about group
methylation details.

-z & -Z: bismark from v0.14.0 produces bam output files by default, so
these options control whether the -R & -S input options expect sam or
bam format alignments.  These options are positional and affect the
inputs following them on the command line.  A mixture of sam and bam
files can be processed by multiple occurrences of -z and -Z.  The
default is sam file input (= -Z).  The use of these options is similar
to that in cleanadaptors.

-c: restrict to the single given chromosome: most useful for testing.

-f, -t, -T, -u, -U, -C, -I: all impose various criteria for numbers
and densities of hits before a fragment will be included in
calculations.

-p, -P, -a, -A, -B, -x, -X, -q, -Q: all control the statistical test
employed.  j & k are a comma-separated pair of values which give the
size limits of fragments, e.g. 40,220.  A value of 0 for either will
negate that limit.  The -B option writes out more information about
the sample methylation levels, using the group identifier followed by
a letter to indicate the sample: e.g. R1a, R1b and R1c would be
successive samples for group 1.

-k and -Y: can allow organisms other than human to be processed
(e.g. Danio rerio: -Y -k 25).  Note that the -G method of specifying
chromosome information with a file is superior to -Y and -k and should
be used in preference.

-I: only calculate fragments for which this number of individuals have
valid counts.  Defaults to 2.

-F: a threshold number of CpGs in any fragment that must reach the
-t-defined count limit for that fragment to be valid.

-M: ignore fragments/bins with methylation below the given proportion
(0.0-1.0).

-j: join adjacent RRBS fragments.  Not always clear how this interacts
with other criteria (-F, -T, etc.).

-N: for SAM (-R) or BAM (-z -R) data count the leading CpG of 3'
mapped reads to the previous fragment if possible, in order to ensure
that these are attributed to the fragment on which they actually lie.

-W: to generate fixed with bins rather than MspI fragments.

Output is to standard out, and the statistical test and degrees of
freedom are indicated.  For Fisher's Exact pairwise comparisons, the
number given is the count of pairwise comparisons that could be
performed for the fragment.

-n: use a file of restriction sites instead of the default MspI site
for cleavage.  The file should only contain a list of cleavage sites
(case independent) one per line, with the cutting position indicated
by a '^' character.  The following would be for a MspI and TaqI
combined digest:

C^CGG
T^CGA

-J: non-CpG methylation.  All C nucleotides are processed.  Other
criteria for fragment or region inclusion should remain the same.

Examples:

1. Identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs), pairwise: the
following command applies Fisher's Exact statistic (-P 40,220) to a
pair of BAM files from the above.  The options given require that at
least 2 CpGs in each fragment have 10 or more hits (-F 2 -t 10) and
that the leading CpG of 3' mapped reads is assigned to the previous
fragment (-N).  Only chromosome 21 is to be used (-c 21).  Chromosome
file information is in the file hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
 -c 21 -P 40,220 -F 2 -t 10 -N -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam -R mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam

The same run can be performed with bam files by including -z before
the first input file:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
 -c 21 -P 40,220 -F 2 -t 10 -N -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam -R mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam

In order to indicate which group (r or R vs s or S) was more
methylated, one of the input sam/CpG files may be identified with -S/-s
options, adding a >Meth column to the output: e.g.

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
 -c 21 -P 40,220 -F 2 -t 10 -N -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam -S mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam

2. Identifying DMRs - ChiSQ test: on a cohort of 6 individuals.  The
following command runs diffmeth using the ChiSQ statistic (-X 40,220)
requiring that at least 2 CpGs in each fragment have 10 or more hits
(-F 2 -t 10), that at least 4 individuals contribute to the statistic
(-I 4) and that the leading CpG of 3' mapped reads is assigned to the
previous fragment (-N).  Only chromosome 21 is to be used (-c 21).
The comparison including control and MDS individuals is intended to
illustrate the use of this statistic with the test data set, not to
imply that there is no difference between the groups:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
 -c 21 -X 40,220 -F 2 -t 10 -N -I 4 -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam \
 -R ctrl_2.fastq_bismark.bam -R ctrl_3.fastq_bismark.bam \
 -R mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam -R mds_2.fastq_bismark.bam \
 -R mds_3.fastq_bismark.bam

3. Comparing methylation between two groups: this applies the ANOVA F
ratio test (-a 40,220), requiring that at least 4 individuals show
counts for a fragment to be included (-I 4) and the leading CpG of 3'
mapped reads is assigned to the preceding fragment (-N).  Sam data for
the treatment/disease group is identified with -S:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
-c 21 -a 40,220 -N -I 4 -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam \
-R ctrl_2.fastq_bismark.bam -R ctrl_3.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam -S mds_2.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_3.fastq_bismark.bam

4. As for 3, but indicate the more methylated group (-A 40,220) and
restrict the output to Pr < 0.01 (-U 0.01).  Each line is suffixed
with a 'R' or 'S' character to indicate which group had higher
methylation and a summary of the valid sample counts for R & S groups.

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
-c 21 -A 40,220 -U 0.01 -N -I 4 -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam \
-R ctrl_2.fastq_bismark.bam -R ctrl_3.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam -S mds_2.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_3.fastq_bismark.bam

5. Compare two individuals with Fisher's Exact Test, using the -R and
-S group formality to make diffmeth generate columns showing the
methylation proportion for each which is the more methylated and
the fold difference in methylation:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
     -P 40,220 -N -F 2 -t 10 -z -R Ind_1.fastq_bismark.bam  -S Ind_2.fastq_bismark.bam


6. For WGBS analysis: for tiled fixed window analysis. The option -W
<windowlength> is added to the command.  E.g. as for 4, but
with fixed width windows of 1000 bp rather than fragments (-W 1000).

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt \
-c 21 -A 40,220 -W 1000 -U 0.01 -N -I 4 -z -R ctrl_1.fastq_bismark.bam \
-R ctrl_2.fastq_bismark.bam -R ctrl_3.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_1.fastq_bismark.bam -S mds_2.fastq_bismark.bam \
-S mds_3.fastq_bismark.bam

7. Same as 5 above, but use a chromosome information file (-G) rather
than -g to run with the autosomal chromosomes.  An example file
hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt is provided in the src distribution directory:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt -P 40,220 -N -F 2 -t 10 \
    -R Ind_1.fastq_bismark.bam  -S Ind_2.fastq_bismark.bam

or if the -R data is a bam file and the -S sam:

diffmeth -G hs_GRCh37_autosomal.txt -P 40,220 -N -F 2 -t 10 \
  -z -R Ind_1.fastq_bismark.bam -Z -S Ind_2.fastq_bismark.sam

8. Generate a list of CpG counts for a combined Taq1 & Msp1 digest,
showing CpGs with > 0 counts.  Do this for H. sapiens chromosome 1
only.  rstsites.txt contains the sites as indicated above (-n), and
the mapping is for a sam file:

diffmeth -G c1_chrinfo.txt -n rstsites.txt -L 40,220 \
  -z -R Ind_2.fastq_bismark.bam

9. List all Cs with non-zero hits for a bam file, only process
chromosome 1:

diffmeth -G c1_chrinfo.txt -J -E 40,220 -z -R x12_c1_bismark.bam

10. Perform a 3 group one way analysis of variance on 9 samples,
chromosome 1 only, writing out methylation level for each sample:

diffmeth -G c1_chrinfo.txt -B 40,220 -N -z -R1 s1.bam -R1 s2.bam \
  -R1 s3.bam -R2 s4.bam -R2 s5.bam -R2 s6.bam -R3 s7.bam -R3 s8.bam \
  -R3 s9.bam

identgeneloc:

Uses feature table information and the output from diffmeth to show
the nearest gene for each fragment.  Feature tables can be read in
EMBL, GenBank, GFF3, GTF and SeqMonk format.  Not all of these have
been thoroughly checked at this stage.  The program looks for Gene,
mRNA and CDS information and attempts to relate these for each
gene. The start and end positions of fragments are then compared with
each Gene in the sense of the gene and the closest gene returned.
Limits can be imposed on how far valid genes can lie from the
fragment.  If TSS and CpG island information is included in the
feature tables then the program will look upstream of the gene for the
nearest such feature.  It is possible, also to find genes for which
the fragment is internal and, in future, this option will extend to
returning information on whether the fragment is located on exons,
introns or intron/exon boundaries

The main returned value is the distance from the end of the fragment
nearest the gene start.

Explanations:

-e, -g, -F, -T, -Q: determine which feature table format is to be
parsed.  At present, the code has been most extensively tested with
the SeqMonk data files distributed with downloaded genomes for
SeqMonk.

-p & -s: are used to specify the feature table files to be located by
<prefix><n><suffix> where <n> is the chromosome number/identifier.
The -G method of specifying feature files is to be preferred over this
older strategy.

-G: A file specifying each chromosome and its feature table file.
Use this option instead of -p & -s if: (1) files are in different
directories, (2) naming is not consistent for -p & -s to work, (3)
genome has chromosome IDs other than numbers, X & Y (e.g. avian or
mitochondrial) or (4) you want a subset of chromosomes.  Format of the
file is lines of <ChromosomeID> <Filename> (e.g. Y
"/Volumes/Data2/SeqMonk_Genomes/Homo sapiens/GRCh37/Y.dat")
Chromosomes in the output will appear in the same order as they are in
the file. Filenames containing spaces should be enclosed in double
quotes '"'.  Any characters on a line after a '#' (if unquoted) will
be regarded as a comment.

-k & -z: for genomes which have different chromosome numbers or lack X
& Y chromosomes (e.g. Danio rerio: -z -k 25).  The -G option makes
this obsolete.

-U,-u, -T: cause CpG and TSS positions and distances (from gene) to be
included in processing.

-I: allow fragments to be found within the genes.

-i: further to -I, identify the fragment position wrt intron/exons if
feature information includes these and the fragment is internal to the
relevant feature.

-b: permit longer input lines: if things are being truncated.

-C: Expects between 3 and 9 tab-delimited items for each input line:
the number must be the same for all input lines.  Use this option if
you have more than 9 items.  Identgeneloc information will be appended
after the information from input lines.

-K: makes the output indicate where the fragment lies in relation to
the gene: this is the usual option in our use.

-B: for feature tables which include a /biotype qualifier
(e.g. SeqMonk) only consider features which match biotypes on the
given comma-separated list.  This helps restrict matches to genes
rather than putative transcripts.  Multiple -B options are accepted
and are equivalent to a comma-separated list.

-q: for GenBank .gbff files, take the gene name from the CDS
/protein_id field rather than the default gene /gene field.  This can
return pfam identifiers for cases where the genome annotation is less
complete.

-m: Use mRNA features to define genes and positions.  The default is
to use 'gene' features, so that this will tend to define the
transcription start site from the corresponding mRNA.  Any -B
constraints on biotype will apply to the mRNA features.

-R: express TSS & CpG island positions as their ranges 5'-3'.

-n: distance to TSS or CpG islands are from the fragment rather than
the corresponding gene.

Examples:

identgeneloc -Q \
-p /Volumes/Data2/SeqMonk_Genomes/Homo\ sapiens/GRCh37/ -s '.dat' \
-r 7smpl_lopr_diffmeth.txt -d 2000 -t -U -I -K > 7smpl_lopr_geneloc_internal_k.txt

uses the SeqMonk feature table information to find genes which are
with 2000bp of each fragment from 7smpl_lopr_diffmeth.txt.  TSS and
CpGi information is to be show and fragments are permitted within
genes.

identgeneloc -Q -G hs_GRCh37_chrinfo.txt \
-r 7smpl_lopr_diffmeth.txt -m -B gene -i -K > 7smpl_lopr_geneloc_internal_k.txt

uses SeqMonk feature table information to find nearest mRNA features
(-m), no distance constraint is applied.  Only mRNAs which contain
/biotype="gene" will be used and an extra column will specify the
relationship between the fragments and intron/exon positions (-i) for
fragments internal to the mRNAs.  The feature table information is
provided by the file hs_GRCh37_chrinfo.txt which contains lines like:

1 "/Volumes/Data2/SeqMonk_Genomes/Homo sapiens/GRCh37/1.dat"
2 "/Volumes/Data2/SeqMonk_Genomes/Homo sapiens/GRCh37/2.dat"
